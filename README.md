# Word Frequency Analyzer
This project utilizes polymorphism, inheritance, and STL objects-oriented design to count the occurrences of words in an input text file. 

# Features
- Inheritance hierarchy with WordDataList subclass
- Two WordList subclasses, one using an STL sequential object container and the other using a circular linked list with an iterator
- Menu-driven test driver with various print options
- Performance measurement in microseconds for parsing and printing routines
- Doxygen formatting documentation and in-text documentation comments

# Installation and Compilation
- Clone the repository with command: git clone[repository-url]
- Navigate to the cloned directory: cd [local-repository]
- Compile the project with makefile using command: make
- Run program after compilation: ./app [filename.txt]
     * replace "filename.txt" with a text file, animals.txt included in repository

# Menu Options (methods of output)
1. Object Array Iterative
2. Object Array Recursive
3. Object Array Pointer
4. Circular List Iterator
5. Circular List Iterator Recursive
6. STL Sequential Container Iterative
7. STL Sequential Container Recursive
8. Exit

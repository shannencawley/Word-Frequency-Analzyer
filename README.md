# Word Frequency Analyzer
This project utilizes polymorphism, inheritance, and STL objects-oriented design to count the occurences of words in an input text file. 

# Features
- Inheritance hierarchy with WordDataList subclass
- Two WordList subclasses, one using an STL sequential objext container and the other using a circular linked list with an iterator
- menu-driven test driver with various print options
- performance measurment in microseconds for parsing and printing routines
- Doxygen formating documentation and in text documentation comments

# Installation and Compilation
Clone the repository with command: git clone[repository-url]
Navigate to the cloned directory: cd [local-repository]
Compile project with makefile using command: make
Run program after compilation: ./app [filename.txt] 
 - replace "filename.txt" with a text file, animals.txt included in repository

# Menu Options (methods of output)
